refactor: Remove automatic failover detection - let user decide

- Organization now only uses JSON metadata, no auto-detection
- Files without metadata are reported with warning in preview
- Added console warnings when models have no .json or no baseModel
- Users must fetch metadata via API or manually organize
- Prevents incorrect automatic moves based on filename/folder guessing

fix: Limit Local Models tab to Checkpoint and LORA only

- Created local_scan_choices with only Checkpoint and LORA
- Changed selected_tags_local to use local_scan_choices instead of scan_choices
- Default selection: both Checkpoint and LORA checked
- Removed unnecessary types from local management view:
  * TextualInversion, Poses, Controlnet, Detection
  * VAE, Upscaler, Wildcards, AestheticGradient
  * MotionModule, Workflows, Other
  * All option removed

Rationale:
- Local Models tab focuses on main model types users organize
- Checkpoint and LORA are the primary model types that need management
- Simplifies UI for common use case
- Other model types can still be managed via Update Models tab if needed

fix: Improve file organization - move all associated files and fix Pony detection

Problem 1 - Associated files not moved:
- Added .html to associated file extensions
- Now moves files with suffixes like .preview.png, .api_info.json
- Moves model.preview.png, model.api_info.json, model.civitai.info
- Added debug prints to track associated file moves

Problem 2 - Pony models not detected:
- Expanded Pony detection patterns: PONY, PONYXL, PONY XL, PONY V6, PONYV6
- CivitAI returns various formats ("Pony", "PonyXL", "Pony V6")
- Now all variants are correctly identified

Problem 3 - baseModel extraction priority:
- Improved get_model_info_for_organization() with 4 fallback sources
- Priority: baseModel > sd version > model.baseModel > version.baseModel
- More reliable extraction from different JSON structures

Additional improvements:
- Added variations for PixArt ("PIX ART")
- Added variations for AuraFlow ("AURA FLOW")
- Better handling of nested JSON data structures

Fixes reported issues where:
- Preview images were left behind after organization
- Pony models stayed in root folder despite correct metadata

docs: Reorder priorities - Phase 5 (Performance) now highest priority

Priority Order Update:
1. Phase 5 (Performance & Polish) - PRIORITY 1 (HIGHEST)
   - Code optimization (async, lazy loading, memory)
   - Error handling & logging
   - Unit & integration tests
   - Performance benchmarks

2. Phase 4 (Advanced Organization) - PRIORITY 2
   - Duplicate detection (next after Phase 5)
   - Storage analytics
   - Bulk operations

3. Phase 2 (API Optimization) - PRIORITY 3
   - Safety checks as needed
   - Full implementation in v2.0.0

Milestone Goals Updated:
- v1.0.0 (March 2026): Complete Phase 5 + Phase 4 + Partial Phase 2
- v2.0.0 (June 2026): Complete Phase 2 + refinements

Rationale:
- Performance and testing are critical for stable v1.0.0
- Code quality foundation needed before adding more features
- Organization features depend on solid performance base
- API optimization can be gradual over time

docs: Streamline roadmap - remove Phase 4 (HuggingFace) and Phase 6 (Enhanced Search)

- Removed Phase 4 (HuggingFace Integration) from roadmap
- Removed Phase 6 (Enhanced Search & Discovery) from roadmap
- Renumbered remaining phases (Phase 5→4, Phase 7→5)
- Updated Phase 4 (Advanced Organization) as HIGH PRIORITY
- Phase 4 now includes completed delete system ✅
- Added detailed breakdown for duplicate detection (next feature)
- Updated milestone goals to reflect new roadmap
- v1.0.0 target: March 2026 (focus on Phase 2 + Phase 4)
- v2.0.0 target: June 2026 (Performance & Polish)

Rationale:
- HuggingFace integration is out of scope for core functionality
- Enhanced search already adequately covered by existing features
- Focus on what users need most: organization and performance
- Clearer path to v1.0.0 release

docs: Refocus project scope - remove HF and Enhanced Search phases

- Removed Phase 4 (HuggingFace Integration) - too complex, low ROI
- Removed Phase 6 (Enhanced Search) - CivitAI website already excellent
- Renumbered phases: Phase 5 → Phase 4, Phase 7 → Phase 5
- Updated priorities: Phase 2 (API) and Phase 4 (Organization) are HIGH
- Added project philosophy section explaining focus areas
- Updated progress table: 44% complete (2 of 5 phases)
- Added Gradio progress bug fix to completed items

New Focus:
- Phase 2: API Optimization (safety, rate limits, performance)
- Phase 4: Advanced Organization (duplicate detection, storage analytics)

Rationale:
- Focus on core strengths: download, organize, manage local collections
- Don't duplicate CivitAI's already excellent search features
- HuggingFace has different ecosystem (ComfyUI Manager better suited)
- Faster path to v1.0.0 with focused scope
