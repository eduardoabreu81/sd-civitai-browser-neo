## 🔧 Known Issues

1. **Forge Neo UI limitation** (Not a bug)
   - Forge Neo's model browser shows all LoRAs from all subfolders mixed together
   - Files are correctly organized in subfolders on disk
   - This is Forge Neo's behavior, not controllable by the extension
   - Workaround: Use Forge Neo's "Extra Paths" feature for separate tabs
